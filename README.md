Medical student report This web application use no extra framworks other than javascript on node js to make API, google oauth2.0, CRUD in MongoDB because I am a newbe in node js so, I do the basic first. I use google Oauth2.0 because google's gmail is well known to every one. For MongoDB, it is flexible and worth to learn.

To use this application, you have to have google and mongodatabase credential keys. Save those key in credentials.json and mnguri.txt respectively at one level outside this folder.

This application is for medical students to use to report medical data with discussion about diagnosis and treatment of individual patient they attended to their staff as a pdf file. The report will be evaluated for quality and consistency and then given back some comments and score in returning.
